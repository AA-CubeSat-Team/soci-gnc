~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What is in here?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
bert_main.c - Backup of the dummy "pre-autocoded" main
ert_main.c - the main.c that has the variables loaded in generated by AACT_autocoder
aact_autocode.py - This is a good chunk of the code for our autocoder
reset.py - resets everything (clears out ert_main.c)
proof.png - proof that this fucking thing works

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WHAT IS THIS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the first test I did to get the generalized variable loader working. Basically this thing reads in some info off of an "input.txt" file and writes some c code inside a fake "ert_main.c" that should allow it populate the correct variables based on this input file.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HOW RUN?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
run these commands,

$: python reset.py
$: python aact_autocode.py
#shit prints out
$: gcc ert_main.c -o mainTest
#make the binary
$: ./mainTest
#run it
